/**
 * Calculates the Dice similarity coefficient and distance over two sets. The
 * similarity is defined as twice the shared information (intersection) divided
 * by sum of cardinalities.
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * similarity(a,b) = 2 * ∣a ∩ b∣ / (∣a∣  + ∣b∣)
 * <br>
 * distance(a,b) = 1 - similarity(a,b)
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * The Dice similarity coefficient is identical to SimonWhite, but unlike Simon
 * White the occurrence (cardinality) of an entry is not taken into account.
 * E.g. {@code [hello, world]} and {@code [hello, world, hello, world]} would be
 * identical when compared with Dice but are dissimilar when Simon White is
 * used.
 * <p>
 * Similar to the overlap coefficient which divides the intersection by the size
 * of the smaller of the two sets.
 * <p>
 * Similar to the generalized Jaccard similarity which divides the intersection
 * by the union of two multisets.
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
