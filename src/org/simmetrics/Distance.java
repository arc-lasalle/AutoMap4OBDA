/**
 * Measures the unnormalized dissimilarity between two arbitrary objects of the

 * The distance measure should be consistent with equals such that

 * <p>
 * The distance measure should be reflexive such that
 * {@code distance(a,a) == 0.0}.
 * <p>
 * The distance measure should be symmetric such that
 * {@code distance(a,b) == distance(b,a)}.

 * The distance measure may be transitive such that
 * {@code distance(a, c) â‰¤ distance(a, b) + distance(b, c)}

 * The distance measure may satisfy the coincidence axiom such that
